        How to prepare for your massage session?
Here are a few things to keep in mind before your session: 
<br>üïí Be On Time: Please be ready 10‚Äì15 minutes before your appointment. This helps us start promptly and use your full time for the massage.
<br>üõèÔ∏è Prepare Your Space: Make sure there‚Äôs a clean, quiet area for the massage. A bed or firm mat works well. Clear distractions for a peaceful session.
<br>üöø Freshen Up: A quick shower before your massage helps you feel refreshed and enhances your comfort.
<br>üì± Limit Distractions: Put your phone on silent and let others know you‚Äôll be unavailable. This is your me-time.
<br>üëö Wear Something Comfortable Loose, easy-to-remove clothing is best. You‚Äôll be properly covered during the session ‚Äî your comfort is our priority.
<br>ü§ù Health & Preferences: Let us know about any allergies, injuries, or areas to avoid so we can tailor your massage to your needs.
<br>‚ùå Respect Is Key: At MmaMassage.ng, we provide strictly professional services. Any inappropriate behavior will result in immediate cancellation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Is there a re-scheduling or cancellation policy?
Yes, please provide at least 12 hours notice if you need to cancel or reschedule your appointment. You can reschedule your session up to 12 hours before the appointment without any penalty. Rescheduling within 12 hours of your booking may attract a rescheduling fee or be treated as a late cancellation.
Cancellations made less than 12 hours in advance will incur a 50% cancellation fee. This helps us manage bookings fairly and compensate our therapists for their reserved time.
      </p>
      <p>
        What happens when the client does not show up after booking?
Clients who fail to show up without prior notice will be charged 100% of the service fee. No-shows affect our schedule and prevent others from booking that time slot.
